Get Datetime from NTP server.

This sends an NTP time packet to the specified NTP server and reads back the response.
The NTP time packet from the server is decoded and returned.

Note: this uses NTP (rfc-1305: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1305.html) on UDP 123.  Because the
function makes a single call to a single server this is strictly a SNTP client (rfc-2030),  
although the SNTP protocol data is similar (and can be identical) and the clients and servers
are often unable to distinguish the difference.  Where SNTP differs is that is does not 
accumulate historical data (to enable statistical averaging) and does not retain a session
between client and server.

An alternative to NTP or SNTP is to use Daytime (rfc-867) on TCP port 13 - although this is an 
old protocol and is not supported by all NTP servers.  This NTP function will be more accurate than 
Daytime (since it takes network delays into account) but the result is only ever based on a 
single sample.  Depending on the source server and network conditions the actual returned time 
may not be as accurate as required.

See comments at the end of the script for an extract of the SNTP rfc.

 
Script Operation, Detail:

Construct an NTP request packet
Record the current local time; This is time t1, the 'Originate Timestamp'
Send the NTP request packet to the selected server
Read the server response 
Record the current local time after reception.  This is time t4.

The received packet now contains:
  t1 - Originate Timestamp (the time the request packet was sent from the client)
  t2 - Receive Timestamp (the time the request packet arrived at the server)
  t3 - Transmit Timestamp (the time the response packet left the server)
(Note that we don't send the originate timestamp (t1) so this will be 0 in the response)

Calculate clock offset and delay:

Estimated Clock Offset 
This is the difference between the server clock and the local clock taking into account
the network latency.  If both server and client clocks have the same absolute time 
then the clock difference minus the network latency will be 0.

Assuming symetric send/receive delays, the average of the out and return times will 
equal the offset.

   Offset = (OutTime+ReturnTime)/2

   Offset = ((t2 - t1) + (t3 - t4))/2      

Adding the offset to the local clock will give the correct time.


Round Trip Delay (= the time actually spent on the network)
This is the total transaction time (between t1..t4) minus the server 'thinking 
time' (between t2..t3)

   Delay = (t4 - t1) - (t3 - t2)

This value is useful for NTP servers because the most accurate offsets will be obtained from
responses with lower network delays.  When considering the single response obtained by this
script the Delay value is only useful as an indicator of the likely quality of the result

Function Get-NtpTime {

<#
.SYNOPSIS
   Gets (Simple) Network Time Protocol time (SNTP/NTP, rfc-1305, rfc-2030) from a specified server
.DESCRIPTION
   This function connects to an NTP server on UDP port 123 and retrieves the current NTP time.
   Selected components of the returned time information are decoded and returned in a PSObject.
.PARAMETER Server
   The NTP Server to contact.  Uses pool.ntp.org by default.
.PARAMETER MaxOffset
   The maximum acceptable offset between the local clock and the NTP Server, in milliseconds.
   The script will throw an exception if the time difference exceeds this value (on the assumption
   that the returned time may be incorrect).  Default = 10000 (10s).
.PARAMETER NoDns
   (Switch) If specified do not attempt to resolve Version 3 Secondary Server ReferenceIdentifiers.
.EXAMPLE
   Get-NtpTime uk.pool.ntp.org
   Gets time from the specified server.
.EXAMPLE
   Get-NtpTime | fl *
   Get time from default server (pool.ntp.org) and displays all output object attributes.
.OUTPUTS
   A PSObject containing decoded values from the NTP server.  Pipe to fl * to see all attributes.
.FUNCTIONALITY
   Gets NTP time from a specified server.

<# Reference Identifier, notes: 

   This is a 32-bit bitstring identifying the particular reference source. 
   
   In the case of NTP Version 3 or Version 4 stratum-0 (unspecified) or 
   stratum-1 (primary) servers, this is a four-character ASCII string, 
   left justified and zero padded to 32 bits. NTP primary (stratum 1) 
   servers should set this field to a code identifying the external reference 
   source according to the following list. If the external reference is one 
   of those listed, the associated code should be used. Codes for sources not
   listed can be contrived as appropriate.

   In NTP Version 3 secondary servers, this is the 32-bit IPv4 address of the

   Leap Indicator (LI): This is a two-bit code warning of an impending
   leap second to be inserted/deleted in the last minute of the current
   day, with bit 0 and bit 1, respectively, coded as follows:

      LI       Value     Meaning
      -------------------------------------------------------
      00       0         no warning
      01       1         last minute has 61 seconds
      10       2         last minute has 59 seconds)
      11       3         alarm condition (clock not synchronized)

   Version Number (VN): This is a three-bit integer indicating the
   NTP/SNTP version number. The version number is 3 for Version 3 (IPv4
   only) and 4 for Version 4 (IPv4, IPv6 and OSI). If necessary to
   distinguish between IPv4, IPv6 and OSI, the encapsulating context
   must be inspected.

   Mode: This is a three-bit integer indicating the mode, with values
   defined as follows:

      Mode     Meaning
      ------------------------------------
      0        reserved
      1        symmetric active
      2        symmetric passive
      3        client
      4        server
      5        broadcast
      6        reserved for NTP control message
      7        reserved for private use

   In unicast and anycast modes, the client sets this field to 3
   (client) in the request and the server sets it to 4 (server) in the
   reply. In multicast mode, the server sets this field to 5
   (broadcast).

   Stratum: This is a eight-bit unsigned integer indicating the stratum
   level of the local clock, with values defined as follows:

      Stratum  Meaning
      ----------------------------------------------
      0        unspecified or unavailable
      1        primary reference (e.g., radio clock)
      2-15     secondary reference (via NTP or SNTP)
      16-255   reserved

   Poll Interval: This is an eight-bit signed integer indicating the
   maximum interval between successive messages, in seconds to the
   nearest power of two. The values that can appear in this field
   presently range from 4 (16 s) to 14 (16284 s); however, most
   applications use only the sub-range 6 (64 s) to 10 (1024 s).

   Precision: This is an eight-bit signed integer indicating the
   precision of the local clock, in seconds to the nearest power of two.
   The values that normally appear in this field range from -6 for
   mains-frequency clocks to -20 for microsecond clocks found in some
   workstations.

   Root Delay: This is a 32-bit signed fixed-point number indicating the
   total roundtrip delay to the primary reference source, in seconds
   with fraction point between bits 15 and 16. Note that this variable
   can take on both positive and negative values, depending on the
   relative time and frequency offsets. The values that normally appear
   in this field range from negative values of a few milliseconds to
   positive values of several hundred milliseconds.

   Root Dispersion: This is a 32-bit unsigned fixed-point number
   indicating the nominal error relative to the primary reference
   source, in seconds with fraction point between bits 15 and 16. The
   values that normally appear in this field range from 0 to several
   hundred milliseconds.

   Reference Identifier: This is a 32-bit bitstring identifying the
   particular reference source. In the case of NTP Version 3 or Version
   4 stratum-0 (unspecified) or stratum-1 (primary) servers, this is a
   four-character ASCII string, left justified and zero padded to 32
   bits. In NTP Version 3 secondary servers, this is the 32-bit IPv4
   address of the reference source. In NTP Version 4 secondary servers,
   this is the low order 32 bits of the latest transmit timestamp of the
   reference source. NTP primary (stratum 1) servers should set this
   field to a code identifying the external reference source according
   to the following list. If the external reference is one of those
   listed, the associated code should be used. Codes for sources not
   listed can be contrived as appropriate.
